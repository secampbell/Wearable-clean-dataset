<h1>Getting and Cleaning Data</h1>

Course project repository the Johns Hopkins 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository

<h2>Project Summary</h2>

Creation of one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following-
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, and, 
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
</ol>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>

Additional information about the variables and data can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
